## ✨ What do we have here?

Here you'll find a collection of solutions and code in a variety of programming languages, covering concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), structured programming, and much more. These examples were followed during my college studies, and I hope they can help you learn and improve your programming skills.

## 👩‍💻 Programming languages

- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-blueviolet.svg)
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-blueviolet.svg)
- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-blueviolet.svg)
- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-blueviolet.svg)

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each programming language, as follows:

```
├── cpp
│   ├── example1.cpp
│   ├── example2.cpp
│   └── ...
├── python
│   ├── example1.py
│   ├── example2.py
│   └── ...
├── java
│   ├── example1.java
│   ├── example2.java
│   └── ...
├── javascript
│   ├── example1.js
│   ├── example2.js
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```
Each directory contains specific examples for the respective programming language.

##  ⌨️ Running the Examples

###   <img align="center" alt="Duda-cplusplus" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/cplusplus/cplusplus-plain.svg"> C++

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

Navigate to the **cpp** directory.

Compile the desired example using the following command:

```
g++ example1.cpp -o example1

```


Run the compiled example using the following command:

```
./example1

```

###   <img align="center" alt="Duda-Python" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg"> Python

Make sure you have the Python interpreter installed on your system.

Navigate to the **python** directory.

Compile the desired example using the following command:

```
python example1.py

```

###   <img align="center" alt="Duda-Java" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-plain.svg"> Java

Make sure you have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.

Navigate to the **java** directory.

Compile the desired example using the following command:

```
javac Example1.java

```


Run the compiled example using the following command:

```
./example1

```

###   <img align="center" alt="Duda-Js" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg"> JavaScript

Make sure you have a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js installed on your system.

Navigate to the **javascript** directory.

Compile the desired example using the following command:

```
node exemplo1.js

```
